## Description üìù
Android Enhancer is a specialized tool designed to optimize the performance of Android devices by modifying specific core parameters. Unlike other optimizers, Android Enhancer employs a universal approach, enabling it to function effectively across a wide range of Android devices. Consequently, it can enhance the performance of various devices, encompassing smartphones, tablets, and other Android-powered devices.

## Working ‚öôÔ∏è
To understand the functioning of the Android Enhancer, please examine the source code located [here](https://github.com/iamlooper/Android-Enhancer/blob/main/src/android_enhancer.cpp). The code currently lacks extensive documentation, but rest assured, I am actively working on improving it.
